# 315P
The code of Aadish Verma, coder of VEX Robotics Competition MS Team 315P.
## Welcome to my little cove of robotics history!
There is a bunch of stuff in this repo - here are the basics:

* **code**: I have several code projects. 1) skills and dt_test/playground, the core files that harbor the most up-to-date version of our version; 2) babybot, testing files to run on a secondary robot; and 3) offense/defense, rounds autons for matches.
* **media**: Mainly related to auton skills. I have pictures of our matchload arrangement and auton skills runs to analyze.
