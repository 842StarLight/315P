# 315P
The code of Aadish Verma, coder of VEX Robotics Competition MS Team 315P.
## Welcome to my little cove of robotics history!
There is a bunch of stuff in this repo - here are the basics:

* **code**: I have two code projects (made using the VEX VSCode extension with V5Python) - a simple offense auton for our alliance, and the auton skills file for the team. The skills file is also the home of our core code architecture, including the most up-to-date driver controls and auton functions.
* **media**: Mainly related to auton skills. I have pictures of our matchload arrangement and auton skills runs to analyze.

IN PROG:
 - [ ] Rewrite auton skills (again) (again).
 - [X] Add test code for printing EVERYTHING about the drivetrain.

TODO (before states):
 - [ ] Fix endgame driver controls.
 - [ ] (if time) Improve turn2 speed

TODO (after states):
 - [ ] Continue improving the drivetrain architecture to be faster and lighter.
 - [ ] Implement PID in turn and drive functions.
