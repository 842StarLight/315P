# 315P
The code of Aadish Verma, coder of VEX Robotics Competition MS Team 315P.
## Welcome to my little cove of robotics history!
There is a bunch of stuff in this repo - here are the basics:

* **code**: I have two code projects (made using the VEX VSCode extension with V5Python) - a simpe offense auton for our alliance, and the auton skills file for the team.
* **media**: Mainly related to auton skills. I have pictures of our matchload arrangement and auton skills runs to analyze.

TODO:
 [ ] Implement PID in turn and drive functions.
 [ ] Rewrite auton skills (again) (again).
 [ ] Fix endgame driver controls.
 [ ] Continue improving the drivetrain architecture to be faster and lighter.
